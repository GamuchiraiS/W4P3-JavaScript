A prime number is an integer greater than 1, that is only divisible by one
and itself.
Devise a function that determines whether or not its parameter is prime,
returning True if it is, and False otherwise. Your program must read an
integer from the user and displays a message indicating whether or not it
is prime.

Devise multiple test cases for your program, and carry out testing to
ensure that your program delivers the expected results
